## Overview

### The challenge

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

### User Story

    AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
    THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned
Using Javascript, I was able to create a password generator that collects user inputs through the browser then outputs a random password. 
The project really helped me gain a foundation on Javascript syntax and it's dynamic relationship with browsers.
